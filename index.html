    <p>I am a Professional Engineer (PE) currently living in Winter Garden, Florida, United States.  I  obtained a bachelor's degree in Electrical/Computer Engineering from the University of Puerto Rico in 1993, and a Master's Degree in Software Engineering from the Polytechnical University of Puerto Rico in 2010.
      I am an Oracle Certified Professional (OCP) - DBA Track - since version 7.3, circa 1998. 
      During my professional life, I have worked as a "C/C++" Language programmer, Oracle Database Administrator, 
      Unix system administrtor, Technical Sales Consultant, Oracle Applications Support Engineer and 
      Implementation Consultant.
      I moved to Orlando Florida in 2013 from Puerto Rico to work with Oracle Corporation as a Senior Principal 
      Support Engineer in the Tier-3 DBA Support Team (Part of Oracle Advanced Support Services), a role I still 
      work at to this day.
      My interests are: anything that has to do with computer hardware and software design, and electronics design
       in general. 
      My hobbies are : Cross-fit, Running, biking, car repair, guitar playing and just spending time with my family.
      I am a big fan of the "Ghost Adventures", TV program from the Travel Channel.
